# I've created simple _JavaScript_ projects ðŸ˜ƒ

## Following are the links of hosted projects:
+ __[Typed JS](https://devmsrajput.github.io/JavaScript-Simple-Projects/Typed%20JS/)__
  > `const main` is the selector for __HTML__ element, where we have to apply this animation. <br><br>
  > `const textArray` contains all texts over which we have to perform iterations. <br><br>
  > `const delay` This is delay time, if the writing stream gets finished then after how much delay the removal stream would start. <br><br>
  > `const writeSpeed` How fast will the writing/removal stream go on. <br><br>
  > `const beepSpeed` It sets the speed of the cursor that blinks next to stream texts. <br><br>
